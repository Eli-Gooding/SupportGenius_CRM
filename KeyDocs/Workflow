# AutoCRM Simplified Workflows

Below is a simplified outline of the **Customer** and **Supporter** workflows within AutoCRM, along with a few suggestions to enhance the user experience and optimize the support process.

---

## 1. Customer Workflow

1. **Login**
   - **Scenario A**: Customer already has an account  
     - They enter their credentials and are taken to their **Dashboard**.
   - **Scenario B**: Customer does not have an account  
     - They must create one by providing:
       - Email  
       - Password  
       - Full Name  
       - Company  
     - After successful registration, they are directed to the **Dashboard**.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Displays the user's **Open Tickets** and **Closed Tickets**.
   - Provides options to:
     - **Create a New Case**  
     - **Chat with a Help Bot** (future feature)

3. **Create a New Case**
   - The user selects from a list of **Categories** that best describe their issue.
   - The user provides a **Short Description** of the problem.
   - A **New Case** is then created and added to their **Open Tickets** list.
   - Selecting a ticket in the list brings the user to a **Ticket Details Page**.

4. **Ticket Details Page**
   - Shows the **entire message history** (sent and received).
   - Displays all **shared files**.
   - Allows the user to **send new messages** (which should appear in real-time for the Supporter).
   - Offers an option to **close the case**.
   - When the Supporter sends a new message:
     - The user sees it in real-time.
     - The user receives an **email notification**.
     - Supporter sets the state to "In Progress"
    - When the Supporter reveives a new message, the state is set to "Requires Response"

5. **Closed Tickets**
   - When viewing a **Closed Ticket**, all content is **read-only**.
   - All buttons/actions (e.g., sending messages, uploading files) are **greyed out** to prevent further updates.

## 2. Supporter Workflow

1. **Login**
   - **No account creation option** for Supporters, as they are pre-registered.
   - After login, the Supporter can choose one of three dashboards:
     - **Unclaimed Cases**
     - **My Cases**
     - **Overview**

2. **Unclaimed Cases**
   - Displays **newly created** (open) cases not yet claimed by any Supporter.
   - Each case shows:
     - **Requester info** (e.g., name, company).
     - **Initial message** or description.
   - The Supporter can **assign the ticket** to any other Supporter (including themselves).  
     - Once claimed, the ticket moves to the **My Cases** dashboard of the assigned Supporter.

3. **My Cases**
   - Divided into two sections:
     - **Open Cases**: active tickets.
     - **Resolved (Closed) Cases**: completed, read-only tickets.
   - For **Open Cases**:
     - The Supporter can view all **past messages** and **files**.
     - They can **send new messages** to the customer.
     - They can **upload new files**.
     - A **Notes** tab is available for internal-only notes. 
       - Each note can have a **title** (or name) and a **text box** for details.
     - There will also be a **priority** field that can be set by the Supporter.
     - A **Ticket History** tab shows the complete timeline of the ticket:
       - Displays all status changes chronologically
       - Shows who made each change (supporter or customer)
       - Includes timestamps for each status change
       - Helps track ticket lifecycle and response times
     - A **Templates** section provides quick access to:
       - Category-specific response templates
       - General-purpose templates
       - Option to insert template and modify before sending
       - Ability to create new templates or edit existing ones
   - For **Closed Cases**:
     - The ticket is **read-only**; no new updates can be made.

4. **Overview Page**
   - Offers **graphical insights** into support performance and metrics.
   - The user can choose **x-axis** and **y-axis** options, such as:
     - **Number of cases** vs. **Company**  
     - **Average response time** vs. **Supporter**  
   - Enables quick identification of bottlenecks or high-volume clients.
